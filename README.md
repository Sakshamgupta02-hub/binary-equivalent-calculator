# Project Title: Binary Equivalent Calculator

# Overview Of The Project
This project creates a tool to convert decimal, octal, and hexadecimal numbers to their binary equivalents. The main objective of the project is the conversion of decimal to binary by repeated division by 2, octal to binary by converting each octal digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent, and hexadecimal to binary by converting each hex digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent. A user interface will allow the user to select the conversion type and input the number, with the program then displaying the final binary result.

# Real Life Problem:
The computers depend upon binary system(0s and 1s) to represent all of their information and to 
perform all of their operations.This conversion is also important for various network devices.In programming, higher level
language is converted into binary code. Since, few low level systems understand only binary code(0s and 1s).

# Features:
This project is useful in converting decimal, octal and hexadecimal number to binary number.

# Technologies Used:
This project uses various concepts of python such as loops, multiple if else, strings, list, etc.

# Steps to run the program:
Step 1) This project first takes input of a number from the user.
Step 2) Then a menu appears on the user's screen which displays the following options:
        1. Decimal to Binary
        2. Octal to Binary
        3. Hexadecimal to Binary
Step 3) Then the user enters his choice.
Step 4) Finally the user gets the output.

# Testing
# Example 1
Enter a number: 128
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Octal to Binary
3. Hexadecimal to Binary
Enter your choice: 
1
The binary equivalent of 128 is 10000000

# Example 2
Enter a number: 600
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Octal to Binary
3. Hexadecimal to Binary
Enter your choice: 
2
The binary equivalent of 600 is 110000000

# Example 3
Enter a number: AB48
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Octal to Binary
3. Hexadecimal to Binary
Enter your choice: 
3
The binary equivalent of AB48 is 1010101101001000
