#Project Title: Binary Equivalent Calculator

#Real Life Problem:
The computers depend upon binary system(0s and 1s) to represent all of their information and to 
perform all of their operations.This conversion is also important for various network devices.In programming, higher level
language is converted into binary code.

#Features:
This project is useful in converting decimal, octal and hexadecimal number to binary number.

#Technologies Used:
This project uses various concepts of python such as loops, multiple if else, strings, list, etc.

#Steps to run the program:
Step 1) This project first takes input of a binary number from the user.
Step 2) Then a menu appears on the user's screen which displays the following options:
        1. Decimal to Binary
        2. Octal to Binary
        3. Hexadecimal to Binary
Step 3) Then the user enters his choice.
