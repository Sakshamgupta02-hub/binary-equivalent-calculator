# Problem Statement
This main aim of the project is to create a program that can convert decimal , octal and hexadecimal number system to their respective binary equivalents.This program involves taking an input from the user (number and choice) and then displaying the desired output (binary equivalent).

# Scope Of The Project
The main aim of the project is to serve as a tool for anyone working with computer systems, from students to software developers. This program helps the user to have a better understanding of how information is stored in the computer's memory which all happens in binary(0s and 1s).It helps students and beginners learn about the relationships between different number systems and how computers work at a fundamental level.

# Target Users
This project targets the audience who wants to have a deep understanding of how a decimal, octal and hexadecimal number system is converted into binary number system.

# High Level Features

Input and validation:
The program asks the user to enter a number in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal format.
The program asks the user to ensure that the number entered is a binary number.

Conversion logic:
The program uses different algorithms depending on the input base to perform the conversion to binary.
For decimal numbers, it can use a loop of divisions by 2 and record the remainders in reverse order.
For octal and hexadecimal numbers, the program converts the input into a 3-bit octal and hexadecimal equivalent.
Output:
The program displays the converted binary number to the user.
It displays the binary equivalent along with the original number entered by the user.
It also displays an error if an incorrect input is given by the user.

User interface:
The program provides a clear and simple interface for the user to interact with.
